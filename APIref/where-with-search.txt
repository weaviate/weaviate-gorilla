With a search operator

Conditional filters can be combined with a search operator such as nearXXX, hybrid or bm25.

The following example adds a points filter to a nearText query, where the points property must be greater than 200. Note that the valueInt is used as the property datatype is int.

```graphql
{
  Get {
    JeopardyQuestion(
      limit: 3
      where: {
        path: ["points"],
        operator: GreaterThan,
        valueInt: 200
      }
      nearText: {
        concepts: ["fashion icons"]
    }
    ) {
      question
      answer
      round
      points
    }
  }
}
```
