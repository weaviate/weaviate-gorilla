Score and ExplainScore in Hybrid Search

Score / explainScore[]

The `score` and `explainScore` sub-properties aim to explain the outputs. They can be retrieved under the `_additional` property.

The below example adds the two properties to the list of retrieved properties.

```graphql
{
  Get {
    JeopardyQuestion(
      limit: 3
      hybrid: {
        query: "food"
      }
    ) {
      question
      answer
      _additional {
        score
        explainScore
      }
    }
  }
}
```
