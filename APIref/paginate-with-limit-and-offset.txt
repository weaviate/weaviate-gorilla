Paginate with `limit` and `offset`

If you only want the `n` results after the first `m` results from the query, you can do this with `limit` and `offset` as shown below.

Be aware that although you will only see `n` results, this could become an expensive operation as `m` grows larger, as Weaviate must fetch `n+m` results.

FOR EXHAUSTIVE RETRIEVAL, USE `after` INSTEAD.

If you want to list and retrieve all objects from a `class`, use the cursor API instead with the `after` operator.

```graphql
{
  Get {
    JeopardyQuestion (
      limit: 1
      offset: 1
    ) {
      question
    }
  }
}
```
