Reranking bm25 search results

The example below uses rerank in a bm25 query to sort the top results for the query "paper" towards "publication" to disambiguate from those related to other meanings, such as the material "paper".

```graphql
{
  Get {
    JeopardyQuestion(
      bm25: {
        query: "paper"
      }
      limit: 10
    ) {
      answer
      question
      _additional {
        distance
        rerank(
          property: "question"
          query: "publication"
        ) {
          score
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```
