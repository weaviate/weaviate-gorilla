### Autocut

Another way to limit the results returned by a similarity search is to use the `autocut` filter. Autocut takes a positive integer parameter `N`, looks at the score of each result, and stops returning results after the `N`th "drop" in score. For example, if the distances for six objects returned by a `bm25` query were `[2.676, 2.021, 2.022, 1.854, 1.856, 1.713]` then `autocut: 1` would return the first object, `autocut: 2` would return the first 3 objects, and `autocut: 3` would return all objects.

Autocut can be used as follows:

```graphql
{
  Get {
    JeopardyQuestion(
      bm25: {
        query: "safety"
      }
      autocut: 1
    ) {
      question
      answer
      _additional {
        score
      }
    }
  }
}
```
