Autocut

Another way to limit the results returned by a similarity search is to use the `autocut` filter. Autocut takes a positive integer parameter `N`, looks at the distance between each result and the query, and stops returning results after the `N`th "jump" in distance. For example, if the distances for six objects returned by `nearText` were `[0.1899, 0.1901, 0.191, 0.21, 0.215, 0.23]` then `autocut: 1` would return the first three objects, `autocut: 2` would return all but the last object, and `autocut: 3` would return all objects.

```graphql
{
  Get {
    JeopardyQuestion(
      nearText: {
        concepts: ["animals in movies"]
      }
      autocut: 1
    ) {
      question
      answer
      _additional {
        distance
      }
    }
  }
}
```
