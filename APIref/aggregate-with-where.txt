Add a conditional (where) filter
You can add a conditional filter to any aggregate search query, which will filter the results set.

The below example searches for objects where the round property equals Double Jeopardy! and returns the object count.

```graphql
{
  Aggregate {
    JeopardyQuestion(where: {
      path: ["round"]
      operator: Equal
      valueText: "Final Jeopardy!"
    }) {
      meta {
        count
      }
    }
  }
}
```
