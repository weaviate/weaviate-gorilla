1. nearText
- `near<Media>` - Finds objects closest to an input medium:
    - E.g.: Use it to find text objects most similar to `cute animals`, or images most similar to a particular image.

You can use these operators to find objects most similar to a raw (un-vectorized) input, such as text or image. For text objects, you can provide an input text to `nearText`, and for image objects, you can provide an input image to `nearImage`. Or either if you are using CLIP.

The example below searches the `JeopardyQuestion` class for the top 2 objects best matching `"animals in movies"`, using `nearText`:

```graphql
{
  Get {
    JeopardyQuestion(
      limit: 2
      nearText: {
        concepts: ["animals in movies"]
      }
    ) {
      question
      answer
      _additional {
        distance
      }
    }
  }
}
```
