## Overall Performance

The experimental results demonstrate strong performance from both GPT-4o and GPT-4o-mini models in generating Weaviate queries:

- Both models achieved high success rates, with GPT-4o successfully handling 304/315 queries (96.5%) and GPT-4o-mini slightly higher at 308/315 queries (97.8%)
- Average AST scores were strong, with GPT-4o at 85.66% and GPT-4o-mini at 83.43%
- The performance difference between models was relatively small (~2.2%), suggesting GPT-4o-mini provides comparable capabilities with potentially better efficiency

## Schema-Specific Analysis

Performance across different schemas showed some variation:

- GPT-4o performed best on Schema 0 (87.97%) and worst on Schema 3 (81.45%)
- GPT-4o-mini was most consistent, with scores ranging from 79.18% to 84.14%
- Both models maintained >79% accuracy across all schemas, demonstrating robust generalization

## Component-Level Insights

Breaking down performance by query component types reveals:

1. Strongest Areas:
   - Boolean filters (GPT-4o: 91.44%, GPT-4o-mini: 88.13%)
   - Boolean aggregations (GPT-4o: 87.03%, GPT-4o-mini: 84.59%)
   - Text filters (GPT-4o: 84.53%, GPT-4o-mini: 85.16%)

2. Areas for Improvement:
   - Search queries (GPT-4o: 76.77%, GPT-4o-mini: 72.48%)
   - Integer filters (GPT-4o: 79.28%, GPT-4o-mini: 76.31%)

3. Complex Operations:
   - GroupBy operations maintained good performance (GPT-4o: 83.53%, GPT-4o-mini: 80.03%)
   - Aggregations across all types averaged above 80% for both models

## Key Takeaways

1. Both models demonstrate production-ready capabilities for generating Weaviate queries, with success rates >96%
2. The smaller GPT-4o-mini model provides comparable performance, making it a cost-effective choice
3. Boolean operations are handled exceptionally well, while semantic search queries present the biggest challenge
4. Performance is consistent across different schemas, indicating good generalization abilities
5. Complex operations like GroupBy and aggregations are handled reliably, suggesting suitability for advanced use cases
