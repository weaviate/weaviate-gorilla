A single-condition filter

To add a filter, you must provide at least one where condition to your query.

The following example specifies that the round property must equal "Double Jeopardy!". Note that the valueText parameter is used since the property datatype is text.

```graphql
{
  Get {
    JeopardyQuestion(
      limit: 3,
      where: {
        path: ["round"],
        operator: Equal,
        valueText: "Double Jeopardy!"
      }
    ) {
      question
      answer
      round
    }
  }
}
```
