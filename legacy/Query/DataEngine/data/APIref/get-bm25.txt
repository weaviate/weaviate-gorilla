Query API: Basic BM25 search

BM25 Search is a keyword scoring algorithm that looks ranks data objects based on the shared keywords between the data objects and the query.

To use BM25 search, you must provide a search string as a minimum.

The below example uses default settings, looking for objects containing the keyword `food` anywhere in the object.

It ranks the results using BM25, and returns the top 3.

Following is an example for a database schema with the Class name `JeopardyQuestion` with properties `question` and `answer`:

```graphql
{
  Get {
    JeopardyQuestion(
      bm25: {
        query: "food"
      },
      limit: 3
    ) {
      question
      answer
    }
  }
}
```

In this example, the query will rank the `JeopardyQuestion` data objects based on the BM25 keyword scoring algorithm with the query "food".

A Natural Language Command for this example could be: "Get me the top 3 JeopardyQuestions that mention food, show the question and answer."
