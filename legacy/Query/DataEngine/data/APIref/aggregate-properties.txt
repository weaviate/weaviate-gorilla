Retrieve aggregated object properties

You can retrieve aggregations of text, number, int, or boolean data types.

The available sub-types vary for each data type, except for type which is available to all, and count which is available to all but cross-references.

Example with text
The following example retrieves information about the most commonly occurring examples in the question property:

```graphql
{
  Aggregate {
    JeopardyQuestion {
      answer {
        count
        type
        topOccurrences {
          occurs
          value
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Example with int

```graphql
{
  Aggregate {
    JeopardyQuestion {
      points {
        count
        sum
      }
    }
  }
}
```
