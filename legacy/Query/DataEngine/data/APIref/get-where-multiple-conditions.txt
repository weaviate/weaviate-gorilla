Multiple-condition filters

To add a multiple-condition filter, you must set the operator to And or Or, and set two or more conditions under the corresponding operands parameter.

The following example specifies and And condition, so that both:

the round property must equal "Double Jeopardy!", and
the points property must be less than 600.

```graphql
{
  Get {
    JeopardyQuestion(
      limit: 3,
      where: {
        operator: And,
        operands: [
          {
            path: ["round"],
            operator: Equal,
            valueText: "Double Jeopardy!"
          },
          {
            path: ["points"],
            operator: LessThan,
            valueInt: 600
          },
        ]

      }
    ) {
      question
      answer
      round
      points
    }
  }
}
```
