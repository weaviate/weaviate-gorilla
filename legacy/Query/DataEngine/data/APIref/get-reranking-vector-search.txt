Reranking vector search results

Using the JeopardyQuestions dataset, let's say we want to find Q&As about flying, and further sort towards the top those about floating. We can start with a nearText search for flying, limited to 10 results:

```graphql
{
  Get {
    JeopardyQuestion(
      nearText: {
        concepts: "flying"
      },
      limit: 10
    ) {
      answer
      question
      _additional {
        distance
        rerank(
          property: "answer"
          query: "floating"
        ) {
          score
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```
