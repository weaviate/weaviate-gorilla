With nearXXX
When using a similarity search operator (i.e. nearXXX) with Aggregate, you should include a way to limit the search results. This is because a vector search in itself does not exclude any objects from the results set - all objects have some degree of similarity to the query.

Thus, for the vector search to affect the Aggregate output, you must set a limit on:

The number of results returned (with limit), or
How similar the results are to the query (with distance).

Set a maximum distance
You can set the distance operator to specify the maximum dissimilarity (i.e. minimum similarity) of results to be aggregated.

The below query retrieves the 10 question objects with vectors that are within a distance of 0.19 to "animals in space", and returns the sum total of the point property.

```graphql
{
  Aggregate {
    JeopardyQuestion(
      nearText: {
        concepts: ["animals in space"],
        distance: 0.19
      }
    ) {
      points {
        sum
      }
    }
  }
}
```
