Retrieve groupedBy properties

You can use the groupBy variable to group the results set into subsets. Then, you can retrieve the grouped aggregate data for each group through the groupedBy properties.

For example, to list all distinct values of a property, and the counts for each:

```graphql
{
  Aggregate {
    JeopardyQuestion(groupBy: "round") {
      groupedBy {
        value
      }
      meta {
        count
      }
    }
  }
}
```
