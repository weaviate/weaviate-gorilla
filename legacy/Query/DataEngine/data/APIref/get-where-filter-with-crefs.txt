Filter using cross-references

You can filter objects using properties from a cross-referenced object.

The following example filters JeopardyQuestion objects using properties of JeopardyCategory that they are cross-referencing.

More speficially, the example filters for the title property of JeopardyCategory objects that are cross-referenced from the JeopardyQuestion object. The title property must include the substring Sport.

```graphql
{
  Get {
    JeopardyQuestion(
      limit: 3,
      where: {
        path: ["hasCategory", "JeopardyCategory", "title"],
        operator: Like,
        valueText: "*Sport*"
      }
    ) {
      question
      answer
      round
      hasCategory {... on JeopardyCategory { title } }
    }
  }
}
```
