Query API: Combining BM25 and the Where Filter

Please note: This is a compositional API, combining the `where` filter with `bm25`.
Add a conditional `where` to BM25 search.

You can add a conditional filter to any BM25 search query using the `where` API, which will filter the outputs but not impact the ranking from keyword scoring.

The below example searches for objects containing the keyword `food` in any field and which have the `round` property of `Double Jeopardy!`, ranks them using BM25, and returns the top 3.

```graphql
{
  Get {
    JeopardyQuestion(
      limit: 3,
      bm25: {
        query: "food"
      },
      where: {
        path: ["round"],
        operator: Equal,
        valueText: "Double Jeopardy!"
      }
    ) {
      question
      answer
      _additional {
        score
      }
    }
  }
}
```

In this example, the query will filter the results where the `round` property equals "Double Jeopardy!" and then rank them based on the keyword scoring algorithm with the query "food".

A Natural Language Command for this example could be: "Show me Jeopardy Questions about food in the Double Jeopardy round, show me the question, answer and Bm25 score."
