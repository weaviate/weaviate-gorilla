By partial matches (text)

With text data type properties, you can use the Like operator to filter by partial matches.

The following example filters for objects including the text "inter" in any part of a token in the answer property.

```graphql
{
  Get {
    JeopardyQuestion(
      limit: 3,
      where: {
        path: ["answer"],
        operator: Like,
        valueText: "*inter*"
      }
    ) {
      question
      answer
      round
    }
  }
}
```
