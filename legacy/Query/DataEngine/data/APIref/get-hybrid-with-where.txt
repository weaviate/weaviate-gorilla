Hybrid Search with Where Filter

You can add a conditional filter to any hybrid search query, which will filter the outputs but not impact the ranking.

The below example performs a hybrid search for `food` in any field from objects that have the `round` property of `Double Jeopardy!`, and returns the top 3.

```graphql
{
  Get {
    JeopardyQuestion(
      limit: 3,
      hybrid: {
        query: "food"
      },
      where: {
        path: ["round"],
        operator: Equal,
        valueText: "Double Jeopardy!"
      }
    ) {
      question
      answer
      round
    }
  }
}
```
