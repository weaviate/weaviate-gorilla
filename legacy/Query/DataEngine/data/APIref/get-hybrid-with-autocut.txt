Autocut in Hybrid Search

Another way to limit the results returned by a hybrid search is to use the `autocut` filter. Autocut takes a positive integer parameter `N`, looks at the score of each result, and stops returning results after the `N`th "drop" in score. Because `hybrid` combines a vector search with a keyword (BM25F) search, their scores/distances cannot be directly compared, so the cut points may not be intuitive.

Autocut can be used as follows:

```graphql
{
  Get {
    JeopardyQuestion(
      hybrid: {
        query: "safety"
      },
      autocut: 1
    ) {
      question
      answer
      _additional {
        score
      }
    }
  }
}
```
