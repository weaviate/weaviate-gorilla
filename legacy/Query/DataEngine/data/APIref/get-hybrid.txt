Basic hybrid search

To use hybrid search, you must provide a search string as a minimum.

The below example uses default settings, looking for:

- Objects containing the keyword `food` anywhere in the object, and
- Objects most similar to the vector of `food`.

It ranks the results using a combination of the `bm25` and vector search rankings, and returns the top 3.

```graphql
{
  Get {
    JeopardyQuestion(
      limit: 3,
      hybrid: {
        query: "food"
      }
    ) {
      question
      answer
    }
  }
}
```
