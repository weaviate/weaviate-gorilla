Add a conditional (`where`) filter

You can add a conditional filter to your search results using the `where` argument.

The example below searches the `JeopardyQuestion` class for the top 2 objects best matching `"animals in movies"`, as long as their `round` property is exactly `"Double Jeopardy!"`:

```graphql
{
  Get {
    JeopardyQuestion(
      limit: 2,
      nearText: {
        concepts: ["animals in movies"]
      },
      where: {
        path: ["round"],
        operator: Equal,
        valueText: "Double Jeopardy!"
      }
    ) {
      question
      answer
      _additional {
        distance
      }
    }
  }
}
```
