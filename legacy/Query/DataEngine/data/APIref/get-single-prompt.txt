Single prompt

A single prompt generative search returns a Large Language Model generated response for each object in the query results. For single prompt generative searches, you must specify which object properties to use in the prompt.

In the below example, the query:

Retrieves two JeopardyQuestion objects related to World history,
Prepares a prompt for each object, based on the prompt "Convert the following into a question for twitter. Include emojis for fun, but do not include the answer: {question}.", where {question} is an object property, and
Retrieves a generated text for each object (2 total), and
Returns the generated text as a part of each object, along with the question property.

```graphql
{
  Get {
    JeopardyQuestion (
      nearText: {
        concepts: ["World history"]
      },
      limit: 2
    ) {
      question
      _additional {
        generate(
          singleResult: {
            prompt: """
              Convert the following into a question for twitter. Include emojis for fun, but do not include the answer: {question}.
            """
          }
        ) {
          singleResult
          error
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

In the below example, the query:

Retrieves two JeopardyQuestion objects related to World history,
Prepares a prompt for each object, based on the prompt "Convert this quiz question: {question} and answer: {answer} into a trivia tweet. where {question} and {answer} are object properties, and
Retrieves a generated text for each object (2 total), and
Returns the generated text as a part of each object.
Note that the question and answer properties are not retrieved in the query, but are used in the prompt.

```graphql
{
  Get {
    JeopardyQuestion (
      nearText: {
        concepts: ["World history"]
      },
      limit: 2
    ) {
      _additional {
        generate(
          singleResult: {
            prompt: """
              Convert this quiz question: {question} and answer: {answer} into a trivia tweet.
            """
          }
        ) {
          singleResult
          error
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```
