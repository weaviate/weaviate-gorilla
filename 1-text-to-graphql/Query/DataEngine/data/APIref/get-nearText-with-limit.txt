nearText with limit

Number of results

You can set the maximum number of results returned with `limit` in the same way as shown in the search basics how-to guide.

Similarly, you can retrieve a maximum `n` objects after the first `m` results by using `limit` with `offset` as shown in the search basics how-to guide.

To limit the number of results returned by a `near...` query, add the `limit` operator. To start at a given offset, add the `offset` operator. For example if we want to obtain the animals in movies #2 and #3 from the `nearText` example above, we'll need to use `offset: 1, limit: 2`. The example below searches the `JeopardyQuestion` class for objects best matching `"animals in movies"`, skips 1 object (`offset`) and returns the next 2 objects:

```graphql
{
  Get {
    JeopardyQuestion(
      nearText: {
        concepts: ["animals in movies"]
      },
      limit: 2,
      offset: 1 
    ) {
      question
      answer
      _additional {
        distance
      }
    }
  }
}
```
