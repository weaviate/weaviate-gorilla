With nearXXX

When using a similarity search operator (i.e. nearXXX) with Aggregate, you should include a way to limit the search results. This is because a vector search in itself does not exclude any objects from the results set - all objects have some degree of similarity to the query.

Thus, for the vector search to affect the Aggregate output, you must set a limit on:

The number of results returned (with limit), or
How similar the results are to the query (with distance).
Set an object limit
You can set the objectLimit argument to specify the maximum number of results to be aggregated.

The below query retrieves the 10 question objects with vectors that are closest to "animals in space", and return the sum total of the point property.

```graphql
{
  Aggregate {
    JeopardyQuestion(
      nearText: {
        concepts: ["animals in space"]
      },
      objectLimit: 10
    ) {
      points {
        sum
      }
    }
  }
}
```
