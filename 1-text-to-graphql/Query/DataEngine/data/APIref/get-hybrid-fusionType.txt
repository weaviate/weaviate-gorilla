Fusion (ranking) method in Hybrid Search

You can select how the BM25 and vector search results are combined to determine the ranking using the `fusionType` argument.

The default is `rankedFusion`, which adds inverted ranks of the BM25 and vector search methods. Alternatively, you can use `relativeScoreFusion` which adds normalized (between 0-1) scores of the BM25 and vector search methods.

The following example specifies the fusion type of `relativeScoreFusion`.

```graphql
{
  Get {
    JeopardyQuestion(
      limit: 3,
      hybrid: {
        query: "food",
        fusionType: relativeScoreFusion
      }
    ) {
      question
      answer
    }
  }
}
```
