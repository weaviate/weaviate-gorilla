nearText with distance threshold

Distance threshold

You can set a threshold for similarity search by setting a maximum `distance`. The distance indicates how dissimilar two objects are.

Multiple distance metrics are available in Weaviate. You can set it in the schema.

The example below searches the `JeopardyQuestion` class for objects best matching `"animals in movies"`, returning those with a `distance` less than `0.18`:

```graphql
{
  Get {
    JeopardyQuestion(
      nearText: {
        concepts: ["animals in movies"],
        distance: 0.18
      }
    ) {
      question
      answer
      _additional {
        distance
      }
    }
  }
}
```
